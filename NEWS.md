1. Implement unit testing
2. Improve `gather_spc` to support gathering of other spectral types into
   tibble list-columns (lcols)
3. Design db connector functions (postgresql and openCPU compatibility)
4. Use futures (first proposed by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise) for asynchronous programming
     -> let the user decide what to parallelize and what not
5. Integrate simplerspec into openCPU
